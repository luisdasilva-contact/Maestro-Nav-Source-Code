# Maestro Nav Source Code
Source code for my 2021 web game, Maestro Nav. Built with Actionscript 2.0 in Flash CS3, the .fla can be opened in any version of Flash from then onwards, but the .swf can only be generated in versions up to CS6. The game is playable [here via Ruffle emulation](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/782669).

Note that all code required for the game to run, including artwork and SFX, are included. The only code **not** including are the Newgrounds API keys. 

All code is provided here for portfolio demonstration purposes. If you'd like to use any of these assets in your project, please let me know! 

A case study containing background and development info will follow shortly.
